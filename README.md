[Translink](http://translink.com.au/) (Organisation) coordinates public transport operations in
South-East Queensland. Their website has an abundance of data with no easy way for a developer
to query it.

Translink (Program) scrapes bus routes, trips, stops and times into a relational database. 
Data is sourced from the [Translink website](http://translink.com.au/).You should be 
aware their data is protected by [copyright](http://translink.com.au/site-information/legal/copyright).

## Usage

    $ translink scrape 2011-11-24

Change the path to the SQLite database.

## Queries

Stops the 130 visits on the outbound trip.

    SELECT DISTINCT(stops.id), stops.stop_name, stops.stop_lat, stops.stop_lon FROM routes
    INNER JOIN trips ON trips.route_id = routes.id
    INNER JOIN stop_times ON stop_times.trip_id = trips.id
    INNER JOIN stops ON stop_times.stop_id = stops.id
    WHERE routes.short_name = '130' AND trips.direction = 'outbound';

Routes that visit the 'Calam Rd near Honeywood St' stop.

    SELECT DISTINCT(routes.id), short_name FROM stops
    INNER JOIN stop_times ON stop_times.stop_id = stops.id
    INNER JOIN trips ON stop_times.trip_id = trips.id
    INNER JOIN routes ON routes.id = trips.route_id
    WHERE stops.stop_name = 'Calam Rd near Honeywood St';
