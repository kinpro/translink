# Translink

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tatey/translink.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tatey/translink)

[TransLink](http://translink.com.au/) (Organisation) coordinates public transport operations in
South-East Queensland. Their website has an abundance of data with no easy way for a developer
to query it.

Translink (Program) scrapes bus routes, trips, stops and times into a relational database.
The schema is a subset of the [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference).
Data is sourced from the [TransLink website](http://translink.com.au/).You should be
aware their data is protected by [copyright](http://translink.com.au/site-information/legal/copyright).

I created Translink (Program) to solve my problem of getting lost on new routes. With this data I 
have been working on an app for iOS called [Next Stop](http://nextstop.me).

## Installation

Translink requires Ruby 1.9.2 or greater. For documentation on how to install Ruby on your
platform, visit the [Download Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) page.

Translink is available as a gem. On UNIX-like platforms, install translink from the command line.

    $ [sudo] gem install translink

## Usage

Scrape all bus stops, routes and services for Thursday, 24 November 2011 saving
them into a SQLite database named "2011-11-24.sqlite3" in the current working directory.

    $ translink scrape 2011-11-24

Change the path to the SQLite database.

    $ translink scrape 2011-11-24 --uri=sqlite:///Users/Tate/Downloads/translink.sqlite3

## Queries

Stops the 130 visits on the outbound trip.

    SELECT DISTINCT(stops.id), stops.stop_name, stops.stop_lat, stops.stop_lon FROM routes
    INNER JOIN trips ON trips.route_id = routes.id
    INNER JOIN stop_times ON stop_times.trip_id = trips.id
    INNER JOIN stops ON stop_times.stop_id = stops.id
    WHERE routes.short_name = '130' AND trips.direction = 'outbound';

Routes that visit the 'Calam Rd near Honeywood St' stop.

    SELECT DISTINCT(routes.id), short_name FROM stops
    INNER JOIN stop_times ON stop_times.stop_id = stops.id
    INNER JOIN trips ON stop_times.trip_id = trips.id
    INNER JOIN routes ON routes.id = trips.route_id
    WHERE stops.stop_name = 'Calam Rd near Honeywood St';

## Schema

Schema is a subset of the [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference)
defined by Google for [Google Transit](https://developers.google.com/transit/google-transit).

### Deviations from the General Transit Feed Specification

* `trips.service_id` is omitted. This cannot be extracted from the dataset.
* `routes.agency_id` is omitted. There is only one agent. The agent is Brisbane Transport.
